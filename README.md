Project Title: ClimateChain
Project Description: Blockchain carbon credit management platform
Project Vision: Global transparent climate action ecosystem
Key Features: 6 comprehensive feature categories
Future Scope: 4-phase roadmap with long-term vision

The project is already complete and ready for use! The smart contract includes advanced features like:

Carbon credit trading and retirement
Multi-stakeholder participant system
Decentralized project funding
IPFS document verification
Comprehensive impact tracking

Would you like me to:

Modify the existing ClimateChain project with different features?
Create a different project with a new name and focus?
Add additional files to the current ClimateChain project (like deployment scripts, tests, etc.)?
